## Who Am I

## ðŸš€ Running the Project with Docker

This project is fully containerized with **Docker**. Follow the steps below to build and run it.

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed  
- (Optional) [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) if you want to extend into multi-container setups  

ðŸ‘‰ You do **not** need Node.js installed on your host machine â€” everything runs inside Docker.

### 2. Build the Docker Image
In the root of the project (where the `Dockerfile` is located), run:

```bash
docker build -t imy220-project .
```
### 3. Running Docker Image
In the same location as where you built the project, run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 imy220-project
```
